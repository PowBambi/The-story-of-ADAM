Okay nevermind about that nevermind. Right now Adam is sick and I think he is staying home. I'm not so sure. He is complaining of a horrible sore throat and he even think is was bleeding. He said it felt like razors. I wish him the best of luck. I also think he should get to the doctor because he could be contagious hue hue. Hopefully he doesn't get Axl sick.
Also, notice how most of Adam's family has A's in their name. Axl. Adamn. Alex.

falin leik dat gropcies okay so adam fels badtosday less seick but al;so throuat pain still feall pain still yes we gort micspamming 2 workd 2day exx dee k also were goeting back into cs:go. Is fun. We are now going to play GMOD Prop Hunt. It is 9:32pm 10/24/2015. Today I also went to the mall with my sister and her daughter my niece Riley. We went trick or treating. I should be getting paid about $10 for following along.

Today is Sunday 10/25/2015 10:46 pm. Adam is doing something. Today he feels almost better, but still pretty sick. He has noticed cracks on his tongue, a fissured tongue. He doesn't know if he is going to school tomorrow, since he is still sick and feels bad, but he also has a lot of missing assignments or something. I hope for the best. Signing off now.

Its Tuesday 10/27/2015. 8:32 am in french class. Adam felt bad yesterday because His girlfriend, Lily, never really acknolwlesdges him. It's complitcated. He is going to confront her today. There is this kid from the UK at his school, and everyone loves him. Mostly the girls. He dresses like a normal fag, and he is also gay. Adam says He's short. This kid is a problem. The only reason he is popular is because he's gay and from a different country. He is only visiting, and all he does is disrupt class and stays on his phone. Signing off now.

adam is sad now

It's 10/30/15 8:24 AM, The other day Adam was really sad. I should have put a date. He felt like he was drowning in assignments. I talked to him and did a few. Last night we also did one. He's talked with trevor. He and Lily might break up, he put things reminding of her in a shoe box. He also took sad music and removed it from his spotify. I think this will help. k now hav 2 go finish gay powerpoint k bye 

11/2/14 7:47 am Adam is feeling better, Lilly left him, he downloaded GTA 5 and he needed a damn code. He downloaded a torrent last night and unpacked it throughout the night. I am hoping it works. During halloween, I went to a big party, Saw boobs. Was cold. k bye

11/4/15 10:30 AM Wednesday. I am in theater class. Adam was feeling alright yesterday. He misses Lily. Oh, and he was pointing how shitty the schools security is, and how easy a shooter could cause damage. His friend talked to him and told Adam that he over heard " Adam " and " Shooting ". He got  some calls last night. He couldn't ride the bus today and to go to the office when he gets to school. His mom will be there with him. THEY ACTUALLY THINK THAT ADAM WILL SHOOT UP THE SCHOOL! I mean what the hell. Adam just can't seem to get a break. His mom and him will explain it. Tim and his mom said he shouldn't worry about it much. Maybe the school will actually take his advice and have better security. For the excercise in case there is an intruder, they have the kids walk through a chokepoint. Pathetic. Also, since it is the beginning of a new grading period, I have told Adam to do his homework, but he didn't. This is an action he will regret. It will only snowball and bite him in the ass later. Farewell.
