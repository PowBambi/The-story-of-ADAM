Okay nevermind about that nevermind. Right now Adam is sick and I think he is staying home. I'm not so sure. He is complaining of a horrible sore throat and he even think is was bleeding. He said it felt like razors. I wish him the best of luck. I also think he should get to the doctor because he could be contagious hue hue. Hopefully he doesn't get Axl sick.
Also, notice how most of Adam's family has A's in their name. Axl. Adamn. Alex.
